# Required Resources for Advanced Phishing Detection

To build a production-grade detection system for websites, emails, and harmful sources, you need the following datasets and resources. The current project lacks **Raw Phishing URLs**, which limits our ability to train a scanner that analyzes URL text patterns.

## 1. Datasets Needed
### A. Phishing URLs (Vital)
We need a large list of actual phishing URL strings (not just features).
*   **PhishTank**: Community-driven, free. (https://phishtank.org/)
*   **OpenPhish**: Free feed of active phishing sites. (https://openphish.com/)
*   **PhishStats**: CSV feeds of phishing attacks. (https://phishstats.info/)

### B. Email Datasets (For Mail Scanning)
*   **Enron Email Data**: Historical corpus, good for "normal" mail baseline.
*   **PhishingCorpus (Nazario)**: Collection of real phishing emails.
*   **SpamAssassin Public Corpus**: Spam vs Ham.

### C. Harmful Internet Sources
*   **Malware Domain List**: Domains hosting malware.
*   **URLHaus**: Malware URL exchange.

## 2. External APIs (Highly Recommended)
ML models are good, but real-time blacklists are better for known threats.
*   **Google Safe Browsing API**: Checks URLs against Google's constantly updated lists.
*   **VirusTotal API**: Aggregates scan results from 70+ antivirus scanners.
*   **AbuseIPDB**: Check if an IP address is malicious.

## 3. Current Model Status
The current model was failing because `phishing.csv` contained **numerical features** (like dot counts) but `scan/input` receives **text URLs**.

**Solution Implemented**:
I have retrained the model using:
1.  **Real Legitimate URLs** (from `tranco.csv`).
2.  **Synthetic Phishing URLs** (Generated by modifying legitimate URLs with phishing keyword patterns) to teach the model to recognize "login", "secure", IP-based URLs, and typo-squatting.

This makes the `AI Scan` functional immediately, but for real-world protection, you should replace the synthetic data with **PhishTank** data.
